- For each related task:
  - Relationship type
  - Coordination needed
  - Review considerations
  - Implementation implications

**Step 3: Review During Implementation**

2. Design targeted experiments (5 experiment types with code examples)
3. Execute experiments and capture findings
4. Consolidate findings and map to questions
5. Quality gate decision (proceed or loop back)

**Quality Gate:** Exit only when all critical questions answered and approach validated

**Benefits:**
- Validates assumptions before full implementation
- Discovers issues when cheap to fix
- Reduces rework through evidence
- Documents decisions with rationale

**Result:** Feature tasks now provide complete, evidence-based, coordinated specifications that lead to secure, observable, maintainable implementations with excellent UX and minimal rework.

**Impact:** +1,440 lines (+15.6%) adding comprehensive guidance that prevents common pitfalls:
- ❌ Incomplete CRUD operations → ✅ Complete matrix
- ❌ Unknown dependencies → ✅ Explicit relationships
