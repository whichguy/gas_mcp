# Craft.md Operational Enhancements

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Session**: Operational Directives & UX Philosophy Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced craft.md with critical operational directives and UX philosophy to improve execution quality and prevent common operational errors.

## Changes Completed

### 1. Empathic "Craft Mindset" Directive (+13 lines)

**Location**: Lines 594-607 (after directory establishment, before Phase 1)

**Content Added:**
```markdown
## Remember: The Craft Mindset

This is iterative quality-driven development. The goal isn't to complete
phases quickly - it's to build something that works and makes sense, grounded
in deep understanding.

**Take your time. Be thorough. Be thoughtful.**

- Understanding comes first: Deep comprehension enables elegant solutions
- Iteration is strength: Revisiting decisions with new insights is growth
- Quality gates protect you: They catch gaps before costly mistakes
- The user is your partner: When uncertain, ask
- Trust the process: Each stage builds on the last
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Sets empathic, thoughtful tone for the entire workflow
- Emphasizes understanding over speed
- Frames iteration as strength, not failure
- Establishes user as collaborative partner
- Builds confidence in the structured approach

### 2. Critical Directory Isolation & Path Discipline (+41 lines)

**Location**: Lines 611-651 (immediately after Craft Mindset, before Phase 1)

**ABSOLUTE RULES:**
```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Directory Isolation & Path Discipline

üö´ NEVER change directories:
- ‚ùå DO NOT use `cd`
- ‚ùå DO NOT use `pushd` or `popd`
- ‚ùå DO NOT change working directory in any way

‚úÖ ALWAYS use full paths:
- ‚úÖ All file operations MUST prefix with `<worktree>`
- ‚úÖ All git operations MUST use: `git -C "<worktree>" [command]`
- ‚úÖ All paths MUST be absolute, never relative
```

**Examples Provided:**
```bash
# CORRECT
Write: "<worktree>/planning/requirements.md"
Read: "<worktree>/src/module.js"
Git: git -C "<worktree>" status

# WRONG
cd <worktree>           # ‚ùå NEVER
git status              # ‚ùå NEVER (missing -C)
../planning/file.md     # ‚ùå NEVER (relative path)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents directory state corruption across operations
- Enables parallel operations without conflicts
- Ensures operations target correct worktree
- Maintains isolation from original project location

### 3. GUIDE.md Template: Directory Isolation Directive (+35 lines)

**Location**: Lines 432-466 (in GUIDE.md template, after "How to Progress Through This Journey")

**Added Section:**
```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Operational Rules: Directory Isolation

**ABSOLUTE RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

üö´ NEVER change directories:
- ‚ùå DO NOT use `cd` command
- ‚ùå DO NOT use `pushd` or `popd` commands
- ‚ùå DO NOT change working directory in any way

‚úÖ ALWAYS use full paths with `<worktree>` prefix:
- ‚úÖ File operations: "<worktree>/planning/file.md"
- ‚úÖ Git operations: git -C "<worktree>" [command]
- ‚úÖ All paths must be absolute, never relative
```

**Why Include in GUIDE.md:**
- Ensures context-lost sessions see critical operational rules
- Prevents common mistakes during session resumption
- Makes rules visible in every worktree's GUIDE.md
- Reinforces discipline throughout entire workflow

### 4. GUIDE.md Template: Visual Workflow Mermaid Chart (+38 lines)

**Location**: Lines 217-254 (in GUIDE.md template, at start of "Current Session State")

**Mermaid Chart Added:**
```mermaid

    style Start fill:#e1f5e1
    style Done fill:#e1f5e1
    style Gate fill:#fff3cd
    style P3 fill:#cfe2ff
```

**Update Directive:**
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è DIRECTIVE: Update this chart when workflow changes
- Add/remove stages or phases as they evolve
- Highlight current position with `style CurrentNode fill:#ffcccc`
- Update connections if dependencies or gates change
- Keep visual representation synchronized with actual progress
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Provides immediate visual orientation for context-lost sessions
- Shows complete workflow at a glance
- Highlights quality gates and iteration loops
- Makes complex workflow understandable
- Directive ensures chart stays current

### 5. UX Enhancement Philosophy in UI Research (+43 lines)

**Location**: Lines 6998-7040 (Phase 2-D, in UI Research section, before "Finalize implementation scope")

**Philosophy Added:**
```markdown
üé® UX Enhancement Philosophy:

Bias toward modern, polished, enhanced user experiences while respecting
architectural and technical constraints:

Favor Enhanced UX When:
‚úÖ Modern UI libraries/components available that match tech stack
‚úÖ Animations/transitions improve clarity without performance cost
‚úÖ Progressive enhancement possible (works without JS, better with it)
‚úÖ Accessibility enhancements available (ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers)
‚úÖ Responsive design patterns well-supported by framework
‚úÖ Loading states, skeleton screens, optimistic updates feasible
‚úÖ Micro-interactions provide feedback (hover, active, focus)
‚úÖ Error recovery patterns improve confidence (undo, retry, clear messages)

Respect Constraints:
‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture decisions override aesthetic preferences
‚ö†Ô∏è Performance budgets respected (bundle size, load time, runtime)
‚ö†Ô∏è Browser support requirements honored (polyfills, graceful degradation)
‚ö†Ô∏è Security requirements non-negotiable (XSS, CSRF, input sanitization)
‚ö†Ô∏è Existing design system followed if one exists (consistency over novelty)
```

**Ask During Research:**
- "What's the most polished, delightful way users experience this interaction?"
- "What modern libraries or patterns make this feel professional?"
- "How can we add polish without violating architectural decisions?"
- "What small enhancements create outsized UX improvement?"

**Example Enhancements (when feasible):**
- Toast notifications instead of alert() dialogs
- Skeleton screens instead of blank loading states
- Inline validation with helpful messaging
- Optimistic updates with rollback
- Smooth transitions between states
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Empty states with helpful guidance
- Progress indicators for multi-step workflows

**Why This Matters:**
- Biases toward modern, polished UX by default
- Respects architectural and technical constraints explicitly
- Provides concrete examples of enhancements
- Guides research toward delightful experiences
- Balances aesthetics with pragmatism

## Impact

**File Growth:**
- Starting: 10,684 lines
