## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Update Claude Desktop Configuration

Edit `~/.claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gas": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/jameswiese/src/mcp_gas/dist/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Restart Claude Desktop

**macOS:**
```bash
pkill -9 "Claude"
open -a "Claude"
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
Stop-Process -Name "Claude" -Force
Start-Process "Claude"
```

**Linux:**
```bash
pkill -9 claude
claude &
```

### 3. Verify Tool Availability

Open Claude Desktop and run:
```
What MCP tools do you have available for Google Apps Script?
```

Expected response should list ~36 tools including:
- File operations (cat, write, ls, etc.)
- Search tools (grep, ripgrep, find)
- Execution (exec, exec_api)
- Deployment (deploy, project_create)
- Version control (versions, logs)
- Authentication (auth)

### 4. Test Basic Operation

Try a simple command:
```
Can you check my GAS authentication status?
```

Expected: Claude should use the `auth` tool with `mode: "status"`

## 📋 Post-Deployment Checklist

### Immediate Verification (Within 1 Hour)
- [ ] Claude Desktop recognizes the MCP server
- [ ] All 36 tools appear in tool list
- [ ] Tool selection works for basic operations
- [ ] Response formats are correct
- [ ] No runtime errors in logs

### Short-term Monitoring (First Week)
- [ ] Tool usage patterns look normal
- [ ] No tool selection accuracy issues
- [ ] User feedback positive
- [ ] Context usage reduced in conversations
- [ ] No unexpected errors

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Tool discovery: 100% of tools visible
- [ ] Tool selection accuracy: No regressions observed
- [ ] User satisfaction: Positive feedback

## 🔄 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### Quick Rollback Process

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/jameswiese/src/mcp_gas

# Save current state
git stash

# Find pre-optimization commit
git log --oneline | grep -B5 "Phase 1"

# Rollback to previous version
git checkout <commit-hash>

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Restart Claude Desktop
pkill -9 "Claude"
open -a "Claude"
```

- Runtime errors occurring frequently
- User experience notably worse
- Critical functionality broken

### Rollback Complexity: **LOW**
- Simple git checkout
- No database migrations
- No API breaking changes
- Clean rollback path available

---

## 📈 Monitoring Strategy

### Logs to Monitor
```bash
# MCP server logs (if available)
tail -f ~/.local/share/claude/logs/mcp-server.log

# Application logs
tail -f /Users/jameswiese/src/mcp_gas/logs/*.log

# System logs for crashes
tail -f /var/log/system.log | grep Claude
```

### Metrics to Track
1. **Tool Discovery Rate**: % of expected tools visible
2. **Tool Selection Accuracy**: % of correct tool choices
3. **Error Rate**: Errors per 100 operations
4. **Response Quality**: User satisfaction scores
5. **Context Usage**: Average tokens per conversation

### Alert Conditions
- Tool discovery < 100%
- Error rate > 1%
- User complaints > 2 in first day
- Runtime crashes
