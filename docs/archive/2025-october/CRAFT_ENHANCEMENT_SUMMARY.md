### 6. Add Movement II-B: Test-Driven Development Flow ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What Was Done:**
Added a new section after Movement II (Criteria Definition) and before Movement III (lines 1237-1347):

```markdown
## Movement II-B: Understanding Through Test Design

üìñ Context Reminder: Before writing code, we clarify understanding through test design.
Review GUIDE.md section "Testing Philosophy: Specifications of Understanding"

**Where We Are in the Journey:**
We've defined WHAT to build (Movement I) and HOW to measure success (Movement II).
Now we design tests that express our understanding as specifications before writing
any implementation code.

**What This Phase Reveals:**
Tests aren't afterthoughts - they're specifications. By designing tests first, we
discover ambiguities in requirements, edge cases we haven't considered, and gaps
in our understanding. This saves massive rework later.

**Your Approach:**

Think through each requirement from Movement II criteria. For each one, ask:
"How would I know this works?" Then express that knowledge as a test case.

**Design Test Scenarios:**

Start with happy path tests - the canonical examples of success:
- What's the typical input?
- What's the expected behavior?
- What's the expected output?

Then edge cases - boundary conditions that reveal understanding:
- Empty inputs, null values, extreme values
- Boundary transitions (0, 1, max, max+1)
- Format variations, encoding issues

Finally error paths - what should NOT happen:
- Invalid inputs should be rejected with clear messages
- Error conditions should be handled gracefully
- Security violations should be prevented

**Document Test Plan:**

Write to `<worktree>/planning/test-plan.md`:
- Test categories (Unit, Integration, Edge Case, Error Path)
- For each test: name, setup, input, expected output, assertions

Use natural language first, not code:
"When user provides negative number, function should throw TypeError with message 'Must be positive'"

**Present Test Plan to User:**

[Present test design conversationally, get confirmation]

**Then Implement Tests:**

Once test design is confirmed, write actual Mocha/Chai tests in `<worktree>/test/`.
These become your specification - implementation will make them pass.

Update GUIDE.md with test plan completion in "Current State of Understanding"
```

**Where Added:** Between Movement II and Movement III (lines 1237-1347)

**Content Added:**
- Context reminder referencing GUIDE.md "Testing Philosophy"
- "Where We Are in the Journey" section
- "What This Phase Reveals" section
- "Your Approach" guidance
- Three test scenario categories: happy path, edge cases, error paths
- Test plan documentation instructions
- User confirmation gate
- Test implementation guidance with Mocha/Chai structure
- GUIDE.md update steps upon completion
- Verification that tests fail initially (TDD pattern)

### 7. Restructure Implementation Loop with Reflective Practice ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What Was Done:**
Transformed Movement III Step 4 (Verify Quality) into autonomous iteration loop with reflective practice:

**Movement III Step 4 Refactoring (lines 2510-2589+):**
- Added reflective philosophy introduction emphasizing learning over box-checking
- Added **‚ö†Ô∏è AUTONOMOUS ITERATION** reminder referencing GUIDE.md
- **Build Verification Loop**: Autonomous iteration until build succeeds
- **Test Iteration Loop**: Autonomous iteration with reflective analysis questions
  * What do failures teach about implementation or understanding?
  * Fix root causes, not symptoms
  * Commit each fix with learning message
- **Code Review Iteration Loop**: Autonomous iteration addressing blocking issues
  * Review patterns/principles missed
  * Refactor to improve design, not just patch
  * Re-run reviewer until issues resolved
- **Criteria Verification**: Calculate quality score, iterate if below threshold
- **Integration Verification**: Test all integration points from Layer 3
- Only proceeds when all quality gates met (tests pass, no blocking issues, criteria met, integrations work)

**Impact:**
- Transforms quality verification from checklist to learning opportunity
- Autonomous iteration reduces user interruptions
- Reflective questions guide better debugging and refactoring
- Emphasizes understanding over mechanical fixes
- Git commits capture learnings for future reference
- Aligns with autonomous iteration directive from Section 10

### 8. Add GUIDE.md Update at Movement Transitions ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- FINAL VALIDATION (verify checkboxes, confirm acceptance criteria, integration test)
- COMPLETE task (fill completion notes, move to tasks-completed/, update log, commit)
- ANNOUNCE task completion with metrics
- Continue to next task

**Task Prioritization (lines 1922-1928):**
- Dependencies first (no pending prerequisites)
- Foundation before features (utilities before features that use them)
- High-risk first (complex/uncertain tasks tackled early)
- User value (visible user value prioritized)

**Autonomous Iteration Within Tasks (lines 1930-1942):**
- Fix failing tests without prompting

### 13. Add Learnings Integration and Per-Task Planning Directive ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What Was Done:**
Enhanced task-based development workflow with continuous learning loop and per-task planning:

**Task Template Enhancement (lines 1854-1865):**
- Added **"Learnings References"** section to task template:
  * Reference relevant lessons from previous tasks
  * Note patterns that worked well
  * Identify pitfalls to avoid
- Added **"Implementation Plan (Pre-Implementation)"** section to task template:
  * Document approach hypothesis
  * Explain how it builds on previous learnings
  * Identify task-specific risks
  * Highlight integration points needing attention

**Task Execution Loop Enhancement (lines 1881-1978):**

  * Note established conventions to follow
  * Identify existing code/projects to integrate
  * Determine if starting fresh or working within existing codebase

- **Consider repository organization strategy** section (lines 1728-1757):
  * **Poly Repo Approach**: Emphasizes multiple related repositories (focused and independent) rather than monorepo
  * **Poly Repo Benefits**: Independent deployments, clearer ownership, simpler CI/CD, smaller codebases, different tech stacks
  * **When to create separate repositories**: Independently deployable services, different release schedules, different teams, reusable libraries, frontend/backend separation
  * **Within this specific repository (worktree)**: Source code location, module organization, test placement, configuration files, documentation structure
  * **Cross-repository considerations**: How repositories relate, shared libraries/dependencies, service communication patterns, documentation distribution

**project-structure.md Template Enhancement (lines 1764-1806):**
- Added **"Existing Structure Assessment"** section:

- Aligns with modern microservices and distributed system architectures
- Prevents accidental creation of monolithic structures in poly repo environments

### 15. Fix Path References to Use <worktree> Prefix ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What Was Done:**
Systematically audited and fixed all path references in craft.md to use `<worktree>` prefix for consistency:

**Path Audit and Fix:**
- Identified 49+ path references without `<worktree>` prefix
- Used sed to batch-fix all `planning/` paths: `sed -i '' 's|`planning/|`<worktree>/planning/|g' craft.md`
- Fixed references in:
  * GUIDE.md section (lines 87, 96-98, 144)
  * Key Documents Reference section (lines 272-278)
  * Movement II-C context reminder (line 1700)
  * Task template references (lines 1861, 1863, 1899, 1910, 1914)
  * All other `planning/` path references throughout craft.md

**Result:**
- 110+ instances now use `<worktree>/planning/` prefix
- Consistent path references across entire document
- Clear worktree context for all file operations
- Prevents ambiguity about where files should be located

**Impact:**
- Eliminates confusion about file locations
- Ensures all paths are relative to worktree root
- Makes it clear that operations happen within isolated worktree
- Aligns with git worktree pattern used throughout craft workflow
- Improves clarity for LLM executing craft commands
- Prevents accidental operations outside worktree boundaries

## Style Guidelines Applied

**Prompt-as-Code Principles:**
- Natural language guidance instead of rigid procedures
- Explains WHY not just WHAT
- Runtime decision-making encouraged
- Knowledge building through reflection
- Conversational, mentoring tone

**Natural Language Patterns:**
- "Think about..." instead of "List..."
- "Ask yourself..." instead of "Check..."
- "This reveals..." instead of "This does..."
- "Your approach..." instead of "The steps are..."

**Knowledge Building:**
- Each section builds on previous understanding
- Explicit connections between layers/phases
- Decision rationale captured
- Learning emphasized over completion

## Testing Needed

After all enhancements are complete:
1. Read through entire craft.md - does it flow naturally?
2. Does each phase teach thinking, not just list steps?
3. Are context reminders natural, not mechanical?
4. Does GUIDE.md actually help rebuild context?
5. Is the language conversational and knowledge-building?

- Movement references: `Movement I/II/III/IV` ‚Üí `Phase 1/2/3/4` in all contexts
- Variable names: `current_layer`, `total_layers`, `layers_confirmed` ‚Üí stage equivalents

**File Path Transformations:**
- `<worktree>/planning/layers/` ‚Üí `<worktree>/planning/stages/`
- `/layer-1-*.md` through `/layer-6-*.md` ‚Üí `/stage-1-*.md` through `/stage-6-*.md`
- `layer-*.md` wildcard patterns ‚Üí `stage-*.md`

**Total Transformations:** 200+ instances across:
- 4 phase headers
- 12 stage headers (6 under Phase 1, 6 under Phase 3)
- 110+ stage/layer references in body text
- 25+ file path references
- Variable name updates throughout

**Impact:**
- Simpler, flatter hierarchical structure (Phase ‚Üí Stage)
- More accessible terminology ("Phase 1" clearer than "Movement I")
- Consistent naming throughout document
- Easier to reference ("Stage 3" vs. "Layer 3")
- Preserves procedural "Step" subsections where appropriate
- Aligns folder structure (`stages/` instead of `layers/`)
- Improves scanability and navigation
- Reduces cognitive overhead for understanding document structure
