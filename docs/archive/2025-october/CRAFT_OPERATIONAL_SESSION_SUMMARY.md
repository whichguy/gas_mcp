---

### Phase 2: Operational Safety Enhancements

**User Request**: "add TODO task: in the beginning of craft.md make an empathic directive, and include this in guide.md : DO NOT CHANGE DIRECTORIES, USE CD NOR PUSHD, BUT RATEHER USE FULL PATHS, GIT -C <fullpath> AS NEEDED, AND ALWAYS PREFIX PATHS WITH <worktree>"

**User Clarification**: "emphatic directive is after the create-worktree directive"

#### Enhancement 1: Empathic "Craft Mindset" Directive

**Location**: Lines 594-607 (after worktree creation, before Phase 1)
**Lines Added**: +13

**Content:**
```markdown
## Remember: The Craft Mindset

This is iterative quality-driven development. The goal isn't to complete
phases quickly - it's to build something that works and makes sense, grounded
in deep understanding.

**Take your time. Be thorough. Be thoughtful.**

- Understanding comes first: Deep comprehension enables elegant solutions
- Iteration is strength: Revisiting decisions with new insights is growth
- Quality gates protect you: They catch gaps before costly mistakes
- The user is your partner: When uncertain, ask
- Trust the process: Each stage builds on the last
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Sets empathic, collaborative tone before workflow begins
- Emphasizes understanding over speed
- Frames iteration as strength, not failure
- Establishes user as partner, not taskmaster
- Builds confidence in structured approach

#### Enhancement 2: Critical Directory Isolation Rules (craft.md)

**Location**: Lines 611-651 (immediately after Craft Mindset, before Phase 1)
**Lines Added**: +41

**Content:**
```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Directory Isolation & Path Discipline

üö´ NEVER change directories:
- ‚ùå DO NOT use `cd`
- ‚ùå DO NOT use `pushd` or `popd`
- ‚ùå DO NOT change working directory in any way

‚úÖ ALWAYS use full paths:
- ‚úÖ All file operations MUST prefix with `<worktree>`
- ‚úÖ All git operations MUST use: `git -C "<worktree>" [command]`
- ‚úÖ All paths MUST be absolute, never relative

**Examples:**
# CORRECT
Write: "<worktree>/planning/requirements.md"
Read: "<worktree>/src/module.js"
Git: git -C "<worktree>" status

# WRONG
cd <worktree>           # ‚ùå NEVER
git status              # ‚ùå NEVER (missing -C)
../planning/file.md     # ‚ùå NEVER (relative path)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents directory state corruption across operations
- Enables parallel operations without conflicts
- Ensures operations target correct worktree
- Maintains isolation from original project location

#### Enhancement 3: Directory Isolation Rules (GUIDE.md Template)

**Location**: Lines 432-466 (in GUIDE.md template, after "How to Progress")
**Lines Added**: +35

**Content:** Same critical rules as above, embedded in GUIDE.md template

**Why This Matters:**
- Context-lost sessions see critical operational rules immediately
- Prevents common mistakes during session resumption
- Makes rules visible in every worktree's GUIDE.md
- Reinforces discipline throughout entire workflow

---

### Phase 3: Visual Navigation Enhancement

**User Request**: "add TODO task: when we create guide.md produce a mermaid chart with a directive to update the chart if the flow changes"

#### Enhancement 4: Mermaid Workflow Chart in GUIDE.md Template

**Location**: Lines 217-254 (at start of "Current Session State" in GUIDE.md template)
**Lines Added**: +38

**Content:**
```markdown
## Current Session State

```

**‚ö†Ô∏è DIRECTIVE: Update this chart when workflow changes**
- Add/remove stages or phases as they evolve
- Highlight current position with `style CurrentNode fill:#ffcccc`
- Update connections if dependencies or gates change
- Keep visual representation synchronized with actual progress
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Provides immediate visual orientation for context-lost sessions
- Shows complete workflow at a glance
- Highlights quality gates and iteration loops
- Makes complex workflow understandable
- Directive ensures chart stays current with actual workflow

### Phase 4: UX Quality Enhancement

#### Enhancement 5: UX Enhancement Philosophy in UI Research

**Location**: Lines 6998-7040 (Phase 2-D, in UI Research section, before "Finalize implementation scope")
**Lines Added**: +43

**Content:**
```markdown
üé® UX Enhancement Philosophy:

Bias toward modern, polished, enhanced user experiences while respecting
architectural and technical constraints:

Favor Enhanced UX When:
‚úÖ Modern UI libraries/components available that match tech stack
‚úÖ Animations/transitions improve clarity without performance cost
‚úÖ Progressive enhancement possible (works without JS, better with it)
‚úÖ Accessibility enhancements available (ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers)
‚úÖ Responsive design patterns well-supported by framework
‚úÖ Loading states, skeleton screens, optimistic updates feasible
‚úÖ Micro-interactions provide feedback (hover, active, focus)
‚úÖ Error recovery patterns improve confidence (undo, retry, clear messages)

Respect Constraints:
‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture decisions override aesthetic preferences
‚ö†Ô∏è Performance budgets respected (bundle size, load time, runtime)
‚ö†Ô∏è Browser support requirements honored (polyfills, graceful degradation)
‚ö†Ô∏è Security requirements non-negotiable (XSS, CSRF, input sanitization)
‚ö†Ô∏è Existing design system followed if one exists (consistency over novelty)

**Ask During Research:**
- "What's the most polished, delightful way users experience this interaction?"
- "What modern libraries or patterns make this feel professional?"
- "How can we add polish without violating architectural decisions?"
- "What small enhancements create outsized UX improvement?"

**Example Enhancements (when feasible):**
- Toast notifications instead of alert() dialogs
- Skeleton screens instead of blank loading states
- Inline validation with helpful messaging
- Optimistic updates with rollback
- Smooth transitions between states
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Empty states with helpful guidance
- Progress indicators for multi-step workflows
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Biases toward modern, polished UX by default
- Respects architectural and technical constraints explicitly
- Provides concrete examples of enhancements
- Guides research toward delightful experiences
- Balances aesthetics with pragmatism

### Phase 5: Implementation Planning Consolidation

**User Request**: "add TODO task: in the feature task genration phase, add a directive to create a feature-tasks.md file with a mermaid chart of all the features that will be developed and in which groupings , but make sure we document which features are related to which other features such that earlier dependent features are completed before their dependents are built"

**User Question**: "should implementation-steps be the same as feature-tasks"

**User Directive**: "merge it"

#### Enhancement 6: Merged Feature Dependency Mapping into implementation-steps.md

**Problem Identified**: Duplication between proposed feature-tasks.md and existing implementation-steps.md
- Both describe task execution order
- Both identify dependencies
- Both document parallel work opportunities
- Both specify coordination needs
- Two files create sync burden and risk inconsistency

**Solution**: Merge into single comprehensive file

**Location**: Lines 6780-7002 (replaced original 82-line template)
**Lines Added**: +142 net lines (223 total - 82 original = +141, plus reference adjustments)

**New Comprehensive Structure:**

1. **Visual Overview** (Mermaid chart at top)
   - Complete dependency graph with solid arrows (hard dependencies)
   - Dotted lines for related features (shared resources)
   - Color-coded phases
   - Update directive

2. **Narrative Execution Plan** (phase-by-phase)
   - Phase 1: Foundation
   - Phase 2: Service Integration
   - Phase 3: Business Logic
   - Phase 4: UI Layer
   - Phase 5: Quality & Polish
   - Each phase includes:
     * Goals and exit criteria
     * Task lists with explicit dependencies
     * Rationale for ordering
     * Parallel work opportunities
     * Related features coordination

3. **Analysis Sections**
   - Critical path analysis (longest dependency chain)
   - Implementation order by week
   - Cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, etc.)
   - Task prioritization principles

4. **Why This Matters**
   - Prevents rework through early dependency identification
   - Enables parallel work through independence identification
   - Improves integration through coordination awareness
   - Increases confidence through complete planning

**Example Mermaid Chart:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    T001[Task 001: Database Schema] --> T005[Task 005: User Service]
    T001 --> T006[Task 006: Invoice Data Layer]
    T005 --> T010[Task 010: Authentication]
    T010 --> T015[Task 015: Protected Routes]
    T015 --> T012[Task 012: Invoice Creation API]
    T012 --> T020[Task 020: Invoice List UI]

    T012 -.shares Invoice model.- T013[Task 013: Invoice Edit API]
    T020 -.shares UI components.- T021[Task 021: Invoice Form UI]
```

**Benefits of Single Consolidated File:**
- Single source of truth (no inconsistency risk)
- Visual + narrative together (chart provides overview, narrative provides detail)
- Reduced maintenance burden (update once, everything stays in sync)
- Better context for AI agents (complete picture in one file)
- Clearer for context-lost sessions (one canonical implementation plan)

**Updated References:**
- Removed all references to separate feature-tasks.md
- Updated Phase 2-D output files list (lines 6772-6778)
- Updated knowledge file references (lines 544-545)
