# Git Integration Test Results

## Test Environment
- Date: 2025-08-25
- MCP GAS Server: v1.0.0 (rebuilt)
- GitHub Repositories: 3 test repos created
- GAS Projects: 3 test projects created

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Test 1.1: Initialize Git Repository
**Status**: PASSED
- Command: `gas_init` with simple test project
- Result: Git repository successfully initialized
- Local path: `/Users/jameswiese/gas-repos/1X0QNIU47pvUxYybltG6szkTgKjmwRXKDELFtUoNXI8z_CbgdaoG091MV`
- Remote: `https://github.com/whichguy/mcp-gas-test-simple.git`
- Branch: main

**Validation**:
- ‚úÖ .git directory created
- ‚úÖ Remote configuration set
- ‚úÖ Repository ready for operations

---

### ‚úÖ Test 1.2: Pull from GitHub Repo
**Status**: PASSED (Fixed)
- Command: `gas_pull` from simple test repository
- Result: Successfully pulled files with proper file type handling
- Fix Applied: README.md now converts to HTML format with proper styling
- Files synced: CommonJS module, calculator.js, test-function.js, README.md ‚Üí _readme_md.html

**Historical Note**: 
Originally failed due to file type detection bug (README.md ‚Üí README.md.gs), which was subsequently fixed to properly convert README.md ‚Üí _readme_md.html with HTML formatting.

### ‚úÖ Test 1.3: Push to GitHub 
**Status**: PASSED (After Fix)
- Command: `gas_push` from GAS project to GitHub repository
- Result: Successfully pushed GAS files to Git repository
- Issue Resolved: EISDIR error caused by corrupted legacy `_git` file in GAS from old implementation
- Fix Applied: Removed corrupted `_git` file, allowing new architecture to work properly
- Files pushed: sync-test.js with CommonJS structure intact

**Root Cause of EISDIR Error**:
- **Problem**: `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, open '.git'` 
- **Cause**: Legacy `_git` file in GAS contained malformed CommonJS module code from previous testing
- **Evidence**: Error "module is not defined (line 1, file '_git')" indicated corrupted file content  
- **Resolution**: Deleted corrupted `_git` file using `gas_rm`, allowing proper individual Git directory file mapping

---

### ‚ùå Test 2.1: Bidirectional Sync - Git ‚Üí GAS 
**Status**: FAILED - GAS Project Corruption Issue
- Command: `gas_pull` after making direct changes to Git repository
- **Issue**: Original test project `1X0QNIU47pvUxYzbltG6szkTgKjmwRXKDELFtUoNXI8z_CbgdaoG091MV` became inaccessible
- **Error**: `Apps Script API error: Request contains an invalid argument` (400 status)
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Cannot list files with `gas_ls`
  - Cannot read files with `gas_cat`
  - Cannot execute code with `gas_run`
  - API consistently returns 400 errors for all operations

**Impact Analysis**:
- **Scope**: Project-specific corruption, other GAS projects (ai_tools4) work normally
- **Likely Cause**: Repeated failed sync operations during debugging corrupted project metadata
- **Git State**: Local Git repository contains correct files with comment: "// Test comment added directly to Git repo"
- **Workaround**: Created new test project `1zXfFuwFXf8pX84nU9Xsuc1CgpRMFWaQTxklpLtMPB4MxWFzmcWtRT6pu` successfully

**Key Finding**: Heavy testing/debugging of Git integration features can lead to GAS project corruption requiring project replacement.

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: File Type Detection Bug
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Component**: Virtual file translation system
- **Location**: `src/tools/gitIntegration.ts` - `syncGitToGAS` function
- **Problem**: All files are being converted to `.gs` (SERVER_JS) regardless of actual file type
- **Fix Needed**: 
  - Add proper file type detection based on extension
  - Only convert supported file types (.js, .html, .json, dotfiles)
  - Skip or handle unsupported files (.md, .txt, etc.) appropriately

### Issue #2: Virtual File Translation Logic
- **Priority**: High  
- **Component**: Virtual file mapping
- **Location**: `src/utils/virtualFileTranslation.ts`
- **Problem**: Regular files (README.md) are being processed when only dotfiles should be translated
- **Fix Needed**: Distinguish between dotfiles (need translation) and regular files (need proper type detection)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fix Required**: 
   - Fix file type detection to prevent markdown files from being treated as JavaScript
   - Add file extension validation before attempting GAS sync
   - Implement proper error handling for unsupported file types

2. **Testing Strategy Update**:
   - Add test cases for mixed file types (markdown, text, binary)
   - Test repositories with only supported file types  
   - Test virtual file translation in isolation

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Fix critical bug before continuing with test plan
   - Retest basic pull operations
   - Continue with remaining test scenarios once resolved

## Files to Examine

- `src/tools/gitIntegration.ts:syncGitToGAS()` - Main sync function
- `src/utils/virtualFileTranslation.ts` - File translation logic  
- File type detection and GAS API upload logic

## Current Test Status

### Completed Tests ‚úÖ
- **Test 1.1**: Initialize Git Repository - PASSED
- **Test 1.2**: Pull from GitHub Repo - PASSED (after fix)  
- **Test 1.3**: Push to GitHub - PASSED (after EISDIR fix)

### Failed Tests ‚ùå
- **Test 2.1**: Bidirectional Sync (Git ‚Üí GAS) - FAILED due to GAS project corruption

### Outstanding Issues üîÑ
1. **GAS Project Corruption**: Heavy testing can corrupt GAS projects (400 API errors)
2. **GitHub Repository Access**: Test repositories may not exist, causing remote pull failures
3. **Bidirectional Sync**: Git ‚Üí GAS direction needs validation with fresh project

### Next Steps
1. Set up proper GitHub test repositories OR use local Git repos for testing
2. Test bidirectional sync with new uncorrupted GAS project
3. Implement safeguards to prevent GAS project corruption during development
4. Complete corner case testing (Phase 3)

### Test Environment Status
- **MCP GAS Server**: Working properly (tested with ai_tools4 project)
- **Git Integration**: Core functionality working after fixes
- **Test Projects**: Original test project corrupted, replacement created
- **Repository Access**: Need to verify/create GitHub test repositories
