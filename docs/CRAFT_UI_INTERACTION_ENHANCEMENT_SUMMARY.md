# Craft.md UI Interaction & Research Enhancement Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Session**: UI Interaction Patterns & Research Phase Enhancement

## Overview

Significantly enhanced craft.md Phase 2-D feature task generation with comprehensive UI interaction patterns and research directives. These enhancements ensure deep consideration of component relationships, CRUD operations, event-driven architecture, state management, and evidence-based UI patterns discovered through parallel web research.

## Changes Completed

### 1. Enhanced UI Interaction Patterns & Component Relationships (lines 6887-7333, +447 lines)

**Location**: Phase 2-D Comprehensive Feature Task Generation Directives, Section 3

Completely rewrote and expanded "UI Interaction Patterns" section with 5 major subsections providing systematic analysis framework for UI components.

#### 1.1 Component Relationship Mapping (lines 6893-6942)

**Parent-Child Relationships:**
- What is the parent component? (layout, page, container)
- What are the child components? (forms, tables, modals, cards)
- How does parent control children? (props passed down, context provided, configuration)
- How do children communicate with parent? (callback functions, events bubbling up, context updates)
- What data flows parent → child? (initial data, configuration, permissions, theme)
- What events flow child → parent? (form submissions, item selections, error notifications)

**Sibling Relationships:**
- What components are siblings? (multiple forms on same page, tabs in tab set, cards in dashboard)
- Do siblings need to coordinate? (one selection affects another, shared state, mutual exclusivity)
- How do siblings communicate? (through parent, shared state, event bus, pub-sub)
- What triggers sibling updates? (user actions in one sibling, external events, data changes)

**Dependency Graph Template:**
```markdown
### Component Dependency Graph for This Feature

**Primary Component:** [Name of main component this task implements]

**Depends On (Upstream):**
- [Component A]: Provides [data/configuration/context]
- [Component B]: Emits [events] this component listens to
- [Component C]: Manages [shared state] this component reads

**Used By (Downstream):**
- [Component X]: Receives [data/events] from this component
- [Component Y]: Responds to [state changes] in this component
- [Component Z]: Displays [results] from this component's actions

**Peer Components (Same Level):**
- [Component P]: Shares [state/context] with this component
- [Component Q]: Coordinates with this component via [mechanism]

**Integration Points:**
- Parent container: [How parent controls this component]
- Child components: [What children this component manages]
- Global state: [What global state this component reads/writes]
- External systems: [APIs, WebSockets, browser APIs this component uses]
```

**Why this matters:**
- Reveals hidden dependencies that must be implemented or mocked
- Identifies integration testing needs
- Prevents breaking changes to upstream/downstream components
- Ensures state management is consistent across component tree

#### 1.2 CRUD Operations Analysis (lines 6944-7021)

**Systematic analysis of all data operations:**

**CREATE Operations (Add/Insert/New):**
- What can be created through this UI?
- Where is "Create" triggered?
- What's the creation flow (6-step process)?
- What validation is required?
- What happens on success/failure?
- Can multiple items be created at once?

**READ Operations (View/Display/Query):**
- What data does this UI display?
- How is data loaded?
- What queries/filters are available?
- How is data refreshed?
- What's the display format?
- Are there multiple views?
- What happens when data is empty or load fails?

**UPDATE Operations (Edit/Modify/Change):**
- What can be edited through this UI?
- Where is "Edit" triggered?
- What's the editing flow (6-step process)?
- Is editing inline or modal?
- Can multiple items be edited at once?
- What's the save strategy?
- What happens to unsaved changes?
- What happens on conflict?

**DELETE Operations (Remove/Archive/Deactivate):**
- What can be deleted through this UI?
- Where is "Delete" triggered?
- What's the deletion flow (5-step process)?
- Is confirmation required?
- What confirmation UI?
- Is deletion permanent or reversible?
- Can deletion be undone?
- Can multiple items be deleted at once?
- What happens to related data?

**CRUD Orchestration Matrix Template:**
```markdown
### CRUD Operations Matrix for This Feature

| Operation | UI Trigger | User Flow | Validation | Success State | Failure State | Bulk Support |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| CREATE | "+ New" button | Modal form → Submit → List updates | Required fields, format | Toast + item appears | Error inline, form preserved | Import CSV (Y/N) |
| READ | Page load, filters | Query → Render list | N/A | Items displayed | Error message + retry | N/A |
| UPDATE | "Edit" icon | Inline edit → Auto-save | Real-time validation | Item updates in place | Error toast + rollback | Multi-select edit (Y/N) |
| DELETE | Trash icon | Confirm modal → Delete | Confirm dialog | Toast + item disappears | Error modal + stays | Multi-select delete (Y/N) |
```

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures all CRUD operations are designed before implementation
- Reveals where confirmation, validation, error handling needed
- Identifies bulk operations that improve UX
- Prevents incomplete implementations (can create but not edit, can delete but no undo)

#### 1.3 Event-Driven Architecture Patterns (lines 7023-7169)

**Event Generation (Publisher/Emitter Role):**
- What events does this component generate?
- When are events emitted?
- What data is included in events?
- Who should receive these events?
- What's the event naming convention?
- Are events synchronous or asynchronous?

**Event Reception (Subscriber/Listener Role):**
- What events does this component listen for?
- Where do these events come from?
- How does component respond to events?
- What's the subscription lifecycle?
- How are multiple events handled?
- What happens on event error?

**5 Event Patterns with Code Examples:**

**1. Direct Event Passing (Parent ↔ Child):**
```javascript
// Parent passes callback to child
<ChildComponent onItemSelected={handleItemSelected} />

// Child emits event by calling callback
const handleClick = (item) => {
  props.onItemSelected(item); // Emit event upward
};
```
- **When to use:** Simple parent-child communication, tight coupling acceptable
- **Pros:** Explicit, type-safe, easy to trace
- **Cons:** Only works for direct relationships, props drilling for deep hierarchies

**2. Event Bubbling (Child → Parent → Grandparent):**
```javascript
// Child emits event
const childButton = <button onClick={() => emitEvent('item:selected', item)}>

// Parent bubbles event up
const handleChildEvent = (event) => {
  // Process or transform event
  props.onEvent(event); // Bubble to grandparent
};
```

**3. Global Event Bus (Pub-Sub Pattern):**
```javascript
// Component A publishes event
eventBus.publish('invoice:created', { invoiceId: 123 });

// Component B subscribes to event
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = eventBus.subscribe('invoice:created', handleInvoiceCreated);
  return unsubscribe; // Cleanup on unmount
}, []);
```

**4. State Management Events (Redux/Context Pattern):**
```javascript
// Component dispatches action (event)
dispatch({ type: 'USER_LOGGED_IN', payload: { userId: 123 } });

// Reducer handles event and updates state
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'USER_LOGGED_IN':
      return { ...state, user: action.payload };
  }
};

// Other components react to state changes
const user = useSelector(state => state.user);
```

**5. Custom Event System (Browser Events):**
```javascript
// Component A dispatches custom event
const event = new CustomEvent('invoice:created', {
  detail: { invoiceId: 123 },
  bubbles: true
});
element.dispatchEvent(event);

// Component B listens for custom event
element.addEventListener('invoice:created', (e) => {
  console.log('Invoice created:', e.detail.invoiceId);
});
```

**Event Flow Mapping Template:**
```markdown
### Event Flow Diagram for This Feature

**Events Generated by This Component:**
1. `item:selected` - When user selects item from list
   - **Payload:** `{ itemId: string, item: Object }`
   - **Recipients:** Parent container (to update detail view), Analytics service (to track selection)
   - **Pattern:** Direct callback to parent + global event bus for analytics

**Events Received by This Component:**
1. `data:refreshed` - When data source is updated externally
   - **Source:** WebSocket server, Parent container, Global state
   - **Response:** Re-fetch data, update list, show "New items available" notification
   - **Pattern:** WebSocket listener + global state subscription
```

**Why this matters:**
- Reveals event-driven dependencies between components
- Ensures proper subscription/unsubscription lifecycle (prevent memory leaks)
- Identifies which event pattern to use (direct vs pub-sub vs state management)
- Prevents event storms (too many events causing performance issues)
- Documents event contracts (payload structure, naming, recipients)

#### 1.4 State Management Patterns (lines 7171-7243)

**6 Types of State:**

1. **Component-Level State:** Local to component (form values, loading flags, UI toggles)
2. **Shared State (Lifted State):** Shared with siblings via parent (selected items, filters)
3. **Global State:** Application-wide (user authentication, theme, language)
4. **Server State (API Data):** Cached API responses (React Query, SWR, Apollo Client)
5. **URL State (Routing State):** Stored in URL for shareability (page number, filters)
6. **Form State:** Managed by form library (React Hook Form, Formik)

**State Management Strategy Template:**
```markdown
### State Management Strategy for This Feature

**Component State (Local):**
- `isModalOpen` - Boolean controlling modal visibility (ephemeral UI state)
- `validationErrors` - Object containing field-level validation errors (form state)

**Lifted State (Shared with Siblings via Parent):**
- `selectedItemId` - String ID of currently selected item (shared with detail view)
- `filters` - Object containing active filters (shared with filter sidebar)

**Global State (Application-Wide):**
- `user` - Current user object with permissions (auth state)
- `theme` - Current theme (dark/light) (UI preference)

**Server State (Cached API Data):**
- `items` - Array of items from API (React Query cache)
- `itemDetails` - Individual item details (SWR cache)

**URL State (Router State):**
- `page` - Current page number (query param: ?page=2)
- `sortBy` - Sort field (query param: ?sortBy=name)

**State Flow:**
1. User changes filter → Update lifted state → Parent passes to this component → Re-query server state
2. User selects item → Update lifted state → Update URL state → Notify siblings
3. Item created → Optimistic update to server state cache → API call → Rollback on failure
```

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures state is stored at appropriate level (not too high, not too low)
- Prevents props drilling (too many levels of prop passing)
- Identifies which state management library to use
- Reveals state synchronization needs (keep multiple states in sync)

#### 1.5 Component-to-API Interaction (lines 7245-7273)

**API Call Triggers:**
- What user actions trigger API calls?
- What non-user events trigger API calls?
- Are API calls immediate or debounced?

**Request Lifecycle:**
- How are API requests managed?
- What loading indicators are shown?
- Can requests be cancelled?
- How many concurrent requests?

**Response Handling:**
- How are API responses processed?
- What happens on success?
- What happens on error?
- How is cache updated?

**Real-Time Updates:**
- Are real-time updates needed?
- What triggers real-time updates?
- How are conflicts handled?

#### 1.6 Application to Task Creation (lines 7277-7333)

**5-Step Process for UI Features:**
1. Map component relationships (dependency graph)
2. Analyze CRUD operations (complete matrix)
3. Design event flows (identify patterns)
4. Plan state management (determine levels)
5. Design API interactions (specify lifecycle)

**Required Templates:**
- CRUD Operations Matrix
- Event Flow Diagram
- State Management Strategy

**Why this deep thinking matters:**
- Missing CRUD operations → incomplete features
- Missing event patterns → components can't communicate
- Missing component relationships → integration failures
- Missing state management → props drilling, inconsistencies
- Missing API interaction design → race conditions, stale data

### 2. UI Research Phase Directive (lines 6761-6883, +126 lines)

**Location**: Phase 2-D Step 2: Create Task Files for Each Feature

Added comprehensive research directive that executes BEFORE finalizing implementation scope.

#### Why This Research Matters

- **Discovers proven patterns** - leverage battle-tested solutions rather than inventing from scratch
- **Reveals user expectations** - understand what users implicitly expect based on similar UIs they've used
- **Identifies pitfalls early** - avoid common mistakes others have made
- **Informs library choices** - find established libraries that solve this problem well
- **Ensures accessibility** - discover accessibility requirements specific to this component type
- **Validates approach** - confirm planned approach aligns with community best practices or justifies deviations
- **Saves implementation time** - reuse proven patterns rather than trial-and-error

#### When to Skip This Research

- Task is not UI-related (backend service, API, data processing)
- Pattern is well-established within this project (follow existing pattern)
- Previous task already researched this component type (reference prior findings)
- Component is trivial (simple button, basic text display)

**For non-trivial UI tasks, this research (30-60 seconds parallel) prevents hours of rework from wrong assumptions about user expectations or missed best practices.**

## Examples

### Complete UI Feature Analysis

```markdown
# Task 020: Invoice List with Inline Editing

## UI Research Findings

**Technology-Specific Patterns (React):**
- Pattern: Use React Query for server state with optimistic updates
- Pitfall: Avoid storing server data in component state (stale data)
- Performance: Virtualize list for >100 items (react-window)

**Community Techniques:**
- Real-world: Reddit r/reactjs recommends react-hook-form + zod for inline editing
- Challenge: Concurrent edits - use optimistic locking with version field
- Library: @tanstack/react-table widely recommended for complex tables

**User Expectations:**
- Expected: Double-click cell to edit, Enter to save, Esc to cancel
- Feedback: Loading spinner in cell during save, error inline
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab between cells), screen reader announces edit mode
- Mobile: Tap to edit, different layout for small screens

**Component Behavior Patterns:**
- Inline editing: Show input on double-click, blur saves, Esc cancels
- Confirmation: No confirmation needed for single cell edit (undo available)
- Animation: Smooth transition to edit mode (200ms), highlight saved cell (green flash)
- Undo: Show undo toast for 5 seconds after save

## Component Dependency Graph

**Primary Component:** InvoiceListTable

**Depends On (Upstream):**
- AuthContext: Provides user permissions (can edit invoices?)
- InvoiceAPI: Server state for invoice list (React Query)
- ThemeContext: Color scheme for edit mode highlighting

**Used By (Downstream):**
- InvoiceDetailView: Receives invoice:selected event to show details
- NotificationService: Receives save events to show toast
- AnalyticsService: Tracks edit completion rate

**Peer Components:**
- FilterSidebar: Shares filter state via parent
- BulkActionsToolbar: Shares selected items state

## CRUD Operations Matrix

| Operation | UI Trigger | User Flow | Validation | Success State | Failure State | Bulk Support |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| CREATE | N/A | (Separate "New Invoice" modal) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| READ | Page load | Query → Render virtualized list | N/A | Items displayed | Error banner + retry | N/A |
| UPDATE | Double-click cell | Edit mode → Type → Enter | Real-time (amount > 0) | Cell highlights green 2s | Error inline + rollback | Multi-select edit (Y) |
| DELETE | N/A | (Separate trash button) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Event Flow Diagram

**Events Generated:**
1. `invoice:selected` - User clicks row
   - Payload: `{ invoiceId, invoice }`
   - Recipients: Parent (update detail view), Analytics (track selection)
   - Pattern: Direct callback + event bus

2. `invoice:updated` - User saves inline edit
   - Payload: `{ invoiceId, field, oldValue, newValue }`
   - Recipients: React Query cache (invalidate), Notification (toast), WebSocket (notify other users)
   - Pattern: State management (React Query mutation)

**Events Received:**
1. `data:refreshed` - WebSocket receives update from another user
   - Source: WebSocket server
   - Response: React Query refetch, show "Data updated" notification
   - Pattern: WebSocket listener → React Query invalidate

2. `filter:applied` - User applies filter in sibling
   - Source: FilterSidebar (sibling via parent)
   - Response: Re-query with filter params
   - Pattern: Lifted state via parent

## State Management Strategy

**Component State:**
- `editingCell` - Object { rowId, field } tracking currently edited cell
- `tempValue` - String holding temporary edit value before save

**Lifted State (via Parent):**
- `selectedInvoiceIds` - Set of selected invoice IDs (shared with BulkActionsToolbar)
- `filters` - Filter object (shared with FilterSidebar)

**Global State:**
- `user` - User object with "invoice.edit" permission

**Server State:**
- `invoices` - React Query cache with optimistic updates

**URL State:**
- `page` - Current page (?page=2)
- `sortBy` - Sort field (?sortBy=date)
```

### Research-Driven Implementation Decision

```markdown
## Implementation Decisions Based on Research

**Decision 1: Use @tanstack/react-table for table management**
- **Rationale:**
  - Community research shows it's most popular (20k+ GitHub stars)
  - Reddit r/reactjs recommends for complex tables
  - Handles virtualization, sorting, filtering out-of-box
- **Alternative considered:** Build custom table
- **Why not:** Reinventing wheel, missing edge cases, performance issues

**Decision 2: Optimistic updates with rollback for inline editing**
- **Rationale:**
  - UX research shows users expect instant feedback
  - Community reports 95%+ success rate makes optimistic viable
  - Pattern documented in React Query best practices
- **Alternative considered:** Pessimistic (wait for server)
- **Why not:** UX research shows slow feedback reduces satisfaction

**Decision 3: Double-click to edit (not single-click)**
- **Rationale:**
  - UX research shows single-click for selection, double-click for edit is standard
  - Prevents accidental edits when selecting
  - Matches Excel/Google Sheets behavior users know
- **Deviation risk:** Some users might expect single-click
- **Mitigation:** Tooltip on hover "Double-click to edit"
```

- ✅ **Evidence-based patterns** (technology docs, community forums, UX best practices researched)
- ✅ **Complete CRUD operations** (matrix ensures no operations missed)
- ✅ **Well-designed events** (5 patterns with guidance on when to use each)
- ✅ **Proper state management** (6 state types with appropriate storage levels)
- ✅ **Validated approaches** (research findings justify implementation decisions)

The enhanced UI interaction directive (+447 lines) and research phase (+126 lines) add **560 lines (+5.6%)** to craft.md, providing comprehensive UI design guidance that prevents incomplete implementations, integration failures, and poor UX from mismatched user expectations.

**Before**: UI features often missed CRUD operations, event patterns unclear, state management inconsistent, implementation based on assumptions.

**After**: UI features systematically address all component dimensions with evidence-based patterns discovered through parallel research, ensuring complete, well-designed, user-expected implementations.
