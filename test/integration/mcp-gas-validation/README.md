## Test Files

### 1. **project-lifecycle.test.ts** - Project Management (6 tests)
Tests project creation, information retrieval, and lifecycle management.

**Key Coverage**:
- ✅ Authentication validation (auth status, session persistence)
- ✅ Project creation (empty projects, verification, listing)
- ✅ Project information (completeness validation)

**Tools Tested**: `mcp__gas__project_create`, `mcp__gas__info`, `mcp__gas__project_list`

---

### 2. **file-operations.test.ts** - File Management (17 tests)
Tests all file CRUD operations, copying, moving, batch operations, and edge cases.

**Key Coverage**:
- ✅ File CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete with verification)
- ✅ Copy and move operations (file copy, move/rename, bulk operations)
- ✅ File listing and patterns (pattern matching with gas_ls)
- ✅ Batch file creation (multiple files, bulk creation with timing)
- ✅ Special characters and edge cases (names, large files 100KB+)
- ✅ File reordering (position management)
- ✅ Concurrent operations (parallel file operations)

**Tools Tested**: `mcp__gas__write`, `mcp__gas__cat`, `mcp__gas__ls`, `mcp__gas__rm`, `mcp__gas__cp`, `mcp__gas__mv`, `mcp__gas__reorder`

---

### 3. **search-operations.test.ts** - Search and Text Processing (21 tests)
Tests search, pattern matching, text processing, and fuzzy matching capabilities.

**Key Coverage**:
- ✅ Basic search with gas_grep (pattern matching, regex, case-sensitive, multi-file)
- ✅ Advanced search with gas_ripgrep (multi-pattern, context lines, sorting, trimming)
- ✅ Text processing with gas_sed (find/replace, regex capture groups, multi-file, dry-run)
- ✅ Find operations (name pattern matching, file type filtering, detailed listing)
- ✅ Fuzzy matching with gas_aider (whitespace variations, similarity thresholds, performance)
- ✅ Search performance (large project search with 20+ files)

**Tools Tested**: `mcp__gas__grep`, `mcp__gas__ripgrep`, `mcp__gas__sed`, `mcp__gas__find`, `mcp__gas__aider`

---

### 4. **module-system.test.ts** - CommonJS Module System (22 tests)
Tests the complete CommonJS module system integration including wrapping, dependencies, and loading behavior.

**Key Coverage**:
- ✅ Module creation with exports (module.exports, exports shorthand)
- ✅ Automatic wrapping/unwrapping (wrapper verification, clean code in gas_cat)
- ✅ Module execution with require() (loading, function calls, caching)
- ✅ Module dependencies (nested requires, multi-level dependencies, dependency chains)
- ✅ loadNow flag behavior (eager loading, lazy loading, execution verification)
- ✅ Circular dependencies (basic and complex circular scenarios)
- ✅ CommonJS debug flag (presence, default state, activation)
- ✅ Error handling in modules (module not found, syntax errors)

**Tools Tested**: `mcp__gas__write` (with moduleOptions), `mcp__gas__cat`, `mcp__gas__raw_cat`, `mcp__gas__run`

---

### 5. **code-execution.test.ts** - Code Execution (21 tests)
Tests ad-hoc code execution via gas_run with expressions, GAS services, and error handling.

**Key Coverage**:
- ✅ Basic expression execution (simple expressions, function returns, complex JavaScript, JSON)
- ✅ Logger output capture (single/multiple Logger.log calls, formatted output)
- ✅ Google Apps Script service calls (Session, Utilities, date formatting, timezone)
- ✅ Error handling (execution errors, syntax errors, runtime type errors, division by zero)
- ✅ Complex code execution (multi-line blocks, try-catch, arrow functions)
- ✅ Module integration (require() in gas_run, multiple module functions)
- ✅ Rate limiting (concurrent execution requests)

**Tools Tested**: `mcp__gas__run`, `mcp__gas__exec`

---

### 6. **deployment.test.ts** - Version Control and Deployment (11 tests)
Tests version control, deployment creation, and deployment snapshot isolation.

**Key Coverage**:
- ✅ Version control (version creation, listing, multiple versions)
- ✅ Deployment management (deployment creation, listing, configuration, API executable)
- ✅ **Deployment snapshot isolation** (versioned deployments serve code snapshots from version creation time, not current HEAD code)
- ✅ **HEAD deployment behavior** (@HEAD deployments always serve current project code)
- ✅ Version history (change tracking, version descriptions)

**Tools Tested**: `mcp__gas__version_create`, `mcp__gas__version_list`, `mcp__gas__deploy_create`, `mcp__gas__deploy_list`

**Critical Insight**: Versioned deployments serve code SNAPSHOTS from the moment the version was created. Changes made after version creation do NOT affect versioned deployments. Only @HEAD deployments serve the current project code.

---

### 7. **error-handling.test.ts** - Error Handling and Edge Cases (20+ tests)
Tests comprehensive error scenarios and graceful recovery.

**Key Coverage**:
- ✅ Invalid parameters (invalid/malformed script IDs, non-existent projects)
- ✅ File operation errors (file not found, invalid move/copy/delete operations)
- ✅ Code execution errors (execution errors, syntax errors, runtime type errors, reference errors)
- ✅ Module system errors (module not found, circular dependency detection)
- ✅ Permission and access errors (permission denied scenarios)
- ✅ Edge cases (empty file content, very long file names, unicode/special characters)
- ✅ Error recovery (recovery from failed operations, project integrity)

**Tools Tested**: All MCP tools (error scenarios)

---

### 8. **performance.test.ts** - Performance and Scalability (15+ tests)
Tests performance with large files, bulk operations, concurrency, and rate limiting.

**Key Coverage**:
- ✅ Large file operations (100KB+, 500KB, multiple large files)
- ✅ Bulk file creation (30+ file creation with timing metrics)
- ✅ Concurrent operations (concurrent writes/reads/mixed operations)
- ✅ Rate limiting (rapid request handling, burst requests)
- ✅ Search performance (grep/ripgrep on 25+ files)
- ✅ Execution performance (rapid execution requests, complex execution timing)

**Tools Tested**: All file operations, search tools, execution tools (performance focus)

---

## Test Organization Principles

### Why Functional Domains?

**Before** (Tool-based organization):
- `basic.test.ts` - Mixed auth, project, file, execution tests
- `commonjs.test.ts` - Only CommonJS tests
- `search.test.ts` - Only search tests
- `extended.test.ts` - Mixed deployment, errors, performance

**After** (Functional domain-based):
- Tests grouped by **what they test** (lifecycle, files, search, modules, execution, deployment, errors, performance)
- Easier to find related tests
- Better test isolation
- Clear test execution strategy
- Improved maintainability

### Standardized Patterns

All test files follow consistent patterns:

1. **Imports**:
   ```typescript
   import { expect } from 'chai';
   import { MCPTestClient, AuthTestHelper, GASTestHelper } from '../../helpers/mcpClient.js';
   import { globalAuthState } from '../../setup/globalAuth.js';
   import { TEST_TIMEOUTS } from './testTimeouts.js';
   ```

2. **Setup/Teardown**:
   ```typescript
   before(async function() {
     this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.EXECUTION);
     // Setup with global auth check
   });

   after(async function() {
     this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.STANDARD);
     // Cleanup test projects
   });
   ```

3. **Test Structure**:
   ```typescript
   describe('Functional Domain Tests', () => {
     describe('Subcategory', () => {
       it('should perform specific test', async function() {
         this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.STANDARD);
         // Test implementation
       });
     });
   });
   ```

## Standardized Timeout Constants

All tests use consistent timeout tiers from `testTimeouts.ts`:

```typescript
export const TEST_TIMEOUTS = {
  QUICK: 15000,        // 15s  - Auth checks, simple queries
  STANDARD: 30000,     // 30s  - File operations, ls, grep, info
  EXECUTION: 60000,    // 60s  - gas_run, require(), module loading
  BULK: 120000,        // 120s - Batch operations (10+ files)
  EXTENDED: 300000     // 300s - Deployment, versioning, full suites
};
```

## Deprecated Test Files

The following test files have been archived with `.deprecated` extension:

- `basic.test.ts.deprecated` - Split into project-lifecycle, file-operations, code-execution
- `commonjs.test.ts.deprecated` - Renamed to module-system.test.ts
- `search.test.ts.deprecated` - Renamed to search-operations.test.ts
- `extended.test.ts.deprecated` - Split into deployment, error-handling, performance

**These files are preserved for reference but are no longer executed by the test suite.**

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. **Choose the appropriate functional domain file** based on what you're testing
2. **Follow the standardized test patterns** (imports, setup/teardown, structure)
3. **Use TEST_TIMEOUTS constants** instead of hardcoded timeouts
