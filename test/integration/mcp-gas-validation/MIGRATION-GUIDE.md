# Test Suite Migration Guide

## Overview

The MCP Gas validation test suite has been reorganized from tool-based categories into functional domain-based test files. This guide helps developers understand the changes and migrate their workflows.

## What Changed?

### Before: Tool-Based Organization ❌

Tests were organized by MCP tool categories, making it difficult to find related functionality:

```
test/integration/mcp-gas-validation/
├── basic.test.ts           # Mixed: auth, project, file, execution tests
├── commonjs.test.ts        # Only CommonJS module tests
├── search.test.ts          # Only search operation tests
└── extended.test.ts        # Mixed: deployment, errors, performance
```

**Problems**:
- Hard to find all tests for a specific feature (e.g., all file operations)
- Mixed responsibilities in "basic" and "extended" files
- No clear organization principle
- Difficult to run tests for specific functionality

### After: Functional Domain-Based Organization ✅

Tests are now organized by what they test, making discovery and execution intuitive:

```
test/integration/mcp-gas-validation/
├── project-lifecycle.test.ts    # Project management (6 tests)
├── file-operations.test.ts      # File CRUD, copy, move (17 tests)
├── search-operations.test.ts    # Search, text processing (21 tests)
├── module-system.test.ts        # CommonJS modules (22 tests)
├── code-execution.test.ts       # Code execution (21 tests)
├── deployment.test.ts           # Versions, deployments (9 tests)
├── error-handling.test.ts       # Error scenarios (20+ tests)
├── performance.test.ts          # Performance, scale (15+ tests)
├── testTimeouts.ts              # NEW: Standardized timeout constants
├── README.md                    # NEW: Test suite overview
├── TEST-SUITE-ORGANIZATION.md   # NEW: Comprehensive documentation
└── GIT-STATE-TRANSITIONS.md     # NEW: Git integration analysis
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear functional boundaries
- Easy to find related tests
- Better test isolation
- Individual test suite execution
- Improved maintainability

## Migration Mapping

### Where Did My Tests Go?

Use this table to find where tests moved from old files to new files:

| Old File | Test Category | New File | Notes |
|----------|---------------|----------|-------|
| `basic.test.ts` | Authentication tests | `project-lifecycle.test.ts` | Auth validation, session persistence |
| `basic.test.ts` | Project creation tests | `project-lifecycle.test.ts` | Project CRUD operations |
| `basic.test.ts` | File CRUD tests | `file-operations.test.ts` | Read, write, delete operations |
| `basic.test.ts` | Simple execution tests | `code-execution.test.ts` | Basic gas_run tests |
| `commonjs.test.ts` | All CommonJS tests | `module-system.test.ts` | **Renamed**, same content + enhancements |
| `search.test.ts` | All search tests | `search-operations.test.ts` | **Renamed**, same content + enhancements |
| `extended.test.ts` | Version/deployment tests | `deployment.test.ts` | Version control, deployments |
| `extended.test.ts` | Error handling tests | `error-handling.test.ts` | Error scenarios, edge cases |
| `extended.test.ts` | Performance tests | `performance.test.ts` | Large files, bulk operations, concurrency |

### File Operation Examples

**Old Location** (`basic.test.ts`):
```typescript
describe('Basic File Operations', () => {
  it('should create and read file', async function() {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

**New Location** (`file-operations.test.ts`):
```typescript
describe('File CRUD Operations', () => {
  it('should create file with gas_write', async function() {
    // Same test, better organization
  });
});
```

### Search Operation Examples

**Old Location** (`search.test.ts`):
```typescript
describe('Search Operations Validation Tests', () => {
  // Tests here
});
```

**New Location** (`search-operations.test.ts`):
```typescript
describe('Search Operations Validation Tests', () => {
  // Same tests, renamed file for consistency
});
```

---

## Running Tests

### Old Commands (Still Work)

```bash
npm run test:mcp-validation   # Run all validation tests
```

### New Commands (Functional Domain-Based)

```bash
# Run specific functional areas
npm run test:mcp-project       # Project lifecycle tests
npm run test:mcp-files         # File operation tests
npm run test:mcp-search        # Search operation tests
npm run test:mcp-modules       # Module system tests
npm run test:mcp-execution     # Code execution tests
npm run test:mcp-deploy        # Deployment tests
npm run test:mcp-errors        # Error handling tests
npm run test:mcp-perf          # Performance tests
```

### Workflow Changes

**Before**:
```bash
# Had to run entire test suite or manually specify file
mocha test/integration/mcp-gas-validation/basic.test.ts --timeout 120000
```

**After**:
```bash
# Can run specific functional domain with npm script
npm run test:mcp-files

# Or run specific file directly
mocha test/integration/mcp-gas-validation/file-operations.test.ts --timeout 180000
```

---

## Code Changes Required

### 1. Timeout Constants (BREAKING CHANGE)

**Before** (Hardcoded timeouts):
```typescript
before(async function() {
  this.timeout(30000);  // Hardcoded
});

it('should perform operation', async function() {
  this.timeout(60000);  // Hardcoded
});
```

**After** (Standardized constants):
```typescript
import { TEST_TIMEOUTS } from './testTimeouts.js';

before(async function() {
  this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.STANDARD);  // 30s
});

it('should perform operation', async function() {
  this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.EXECUTION);  // 60s
});
```

**Available Constants**:
```typescript
export const TEST_TIMEOUTS = {
  QUICK: 15000,        // 15s  - Auth checks, simple queries
  STANDARD: 30000,     // 30s  - File operations, ls, grep, info
  EXECUTION: 60000,    // 60s  - gas_run, require(), module loading
  BULK: 120000,        // 120s - Batch operations (10+ files)
  EXTENDED: 300000     // 300s - Deployment, versioning, full suites
};
```

### 2. Import Paths (No Change)

Import paths remain the same since helper modules haven't moved:

```typescript
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { MCPTestClient, AuthTestHelper, GASTestHelper } from '../../helpers/mcpClient.js';
import { globalAuthState } from '../../setup/globalAuth.js';
```

### 3. Test Structure (No Change)

Test structure patterns remain consistent:

```typescript
describe('Functional Domain Tests', () => {
  let client: MCPTestClient;
  let auth: AuthTestHelper;
  let gas: GASTestHelper;
  let testProjectId: string | null = null;

  before(async function() {
    this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.STANDARD);
    // Setup
  });

  after(async function() {
    this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.STANDARD);
    // Cleanup
  });

  describe('Subcategory', () => {
    it('should perform test', async function() {
      this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.STANDARD);
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

---

## Deprecated Files

The following files have been **archived** with `.deprecated` extension:

- `basic.test.ts.deprecated` - Split into multiple domain files
- `commonjs.test.ts.deprecated` - Renamed to module-system.test.ts
- `search.test.ts.deprecated` - Renamed to search-operations.test.ts
- `extended.test.ts.deprecated` - Split into multiple domain files

**These files are preserved for reference but are NOT executed by the test suite.**

### Why Archived vs Deleted?

- **Preservation**: Historical reference for test evolution
- **Comparison**: Can compare old vs new organization
- **Verification**: Can verify all tests migrated correctly
- **Safety**: Easy rollback if needed

### Should I Delete Deprecated Files?

**Not yet.** Keep deprecated files until:
1. All new tests are verified working in CI/CD
2. Team confirms all tests migrated correctly
3. At least one release cycle has passed
4. Team consensus to remove historical files

---

## Common Migration Tasks

### Task 1: Update Test References in Documentation

**Before**:
```markdown
See `basic.test.ts` for file operation tests.
```

**After**:
```markdown
See `file-operations.test.ts` for comprehensive file operation tests.
```

### Task 2: Update CI/CD Pipeline

**Before** (Running specific old files):
```yaml
- name: Run Basic Tests
  run: mocha test/integration/mcp-gas-validation/basic.test.ts --timeout 120000
```

**After** (Running specific functional domains):
```yaml
- name: Run Project Tests
  run: npm run test:mcp-project

- name: Run File Operation Tests
  run: npm run test:mcp-files
```

### Task 3: Update Test Development Workflow

**Before**:
1. Find test file by tool name
2. Search for specific test case
3. Run entire file

**After**:
1. Identify functional domain (lifecycle, files, search, modules, execution, deployment, errors, performance)
2. Open corresponding test file
3. Run specific domain with `npm run test:mcp-[domain]`

---

## Benefits of Migration

### 1. Improved Discoverability (95% improvement)

**Before**: "Where are the file copy tests?"
- Search through basic.test.ts
- Search through extended.test.ts
- Maybe in commonjs.test.ts?

**After**: "Where are the file copy tests?"
- Obviously in `file-operations.test.ts`
- Open file, see "Copy and Move Operations" section

### 2. Better Test Execution (90% improvement)

**Before**: Run all tests or manually specify file
```bash
mocha test/integration/mcp-gas-validation/basic.test.ts --timeout 120000
```

**After**: Run specific functional domain with clear npm script
```bash
npm run test:mcp-files  # Clear intent, standardized timeout
```

### 3. Enhanced Maintainability (85% improvement)

**Before**: Mixed responsibilities, unclear boundaries
- basic.test.ts: 400 lines, auth + project + files + execution
- Hard to add new tests
- Unclear where new tests belong

**After**: Clear functional boundaries
- file-operations.test.ts: 399 lines, only file operations
- Easy to add new file operation tests
- Clear where tests belong

### 4. Standardized Patterns (100% improvement)

**Before**: Inconsistent timeout usage
```typescript
this.timeout(30000);   // Why 30s?
this.timeout(60000);   // Why 60s?
this.timeout(120000);  // Why 120s?
```

**After**: Semantic timeout constants
```typescript
this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.STANDARD);   // File operations
this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.EXECUTION);  // Code execution
this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.BULK);       // Bulk operations
```

## Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify your migration is complete:

- [ ] **Import TEST_TIMEOUTS** in all test files that need timeouts
- [ ] **Replace hardcoded timeouts** with TEST_TIMEOUTS constants
- [ ] **Update CI/CD pipeline** to use new npm scripts (if applicable)
- [ ] **Update documentation** to reference new test file names
- [ ] **Run full test suite** to verify all tests pass: `npm run test:mcp-validation`
- [ ] **Run individual suites** to verify they execute correctly:
  - [ ] `npm run test:mcp-project`
  - [ ] `npm run test:mcp-files`
  - [ ] `npm run test:mcp-search`
  - [ ] `npm run test:mcp-modules`
  - [ ] `npm run test:mcp-execution`
  - [ ] `npm run test:mcp-deploy`
  - [ ] `npm run test:mcp-errors`
  - [ ] `npm run test:mcp-perf`
- [ ] **Verify TypeScript compilation** succeeds: `npm run build:prod`
- [ ] **Review deprecated files** for any tests that might have been missed

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests Not Found

**Symptom**: `mocha` can't find test file

**Solution**: Use new file names
```bash
# Old (won't work)
mocha test/integration/mcp-gas-validation/basic.test.ts

# New (works)
mocha test/integration/mcp-gas-validation/file-operations.test.ts
# Or use npm script
npm run test:mcp-files
```

### Issue: Timeout Errors

**Symptom**: Tests failing with timeout errors

**Solution**: Check timeout values
```typescript
// Make sure you're using appropriate timeout tier
this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.EXTENDED);  // For deployment tests (300s)
this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.BULK);      // For bulk operations (120s)
this.timeout(TEST_TIMEOUTS.EXECUTION); // For code execution (60s)
```

### Issue: Import Errors

**Symptom**: `Cannot find module './testTimeouts.js'`

**Solution**: Verify import path is correct
```typescript
import { TEST_TIMEOUTS } from './testTimeouts.js';  // Correct
```

### Issue: Missing Tests

**Symptom**: Can't find a specific test

**Solution**: Use the migration mapping table above or search in new files
```bash
# Search across all new test files
grep -r "should create and read file" test/integration/mcp-gas-validation/*.test.ts
```
