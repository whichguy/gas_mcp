- `src/tools/raw-aider.ts` (511 lines)

## Executive Summary

Both AiderTool and RawAiderTool implement fuzzy string matching for file editing using Levenshtein distance. After deep analysis, I've identified **6 critical logic issues** and **3 optimization opportunities** that could impact correctness and performance.

---

## Critical Logic Issues

### 1. **Sequential Edit Interference** (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Location**: Both files, lines 309-347 (aider.ts) and 292-330 (raw-aider.ts)

**Problem**: When multiple edits are applied sequentially, earlier replacements can invalidate the positions found for later edits. The fuzzy matcher searches in the original content, but replacements are applied to a progressively modified content string.

**Example Scenario**:
```javascript
// Original content: "function test() { return 1; }"
// Edit 1: searchText="function test()", replaceText="async function test()"
// Edit 2: searchText="return 1", replaceText="return await getValue()"

// What happens:
// 1. Match found for "function test()" at position 0
// 2. Content becomes: "async function test() { return 1; }"
// 3. Match search for "return 1" operates on NEW content (correct)
// 4. But if Edit 2's match overlaps with Edit 1's replacement zone...
```

**Current Code**:
```typescript
for (const [idx, edit] of params.edits.entries()) {
  const match = this.findFuzzyMatch(content, searchText, similarityThreshold);
  // ❌ Content has been modified by previous edits
  content = content.substring(0, match.position) +
            replaceText +
            content.substring(match.position + match.text.length);
}
```

**Impact**:
- Edits might fail to find matches after earlier edits change the content
- Replacements could overlap and corrupt the file
- No validation that edits don't interfere with each other

**Recommendation**:
1. Track position offsets as edits are applied
2. Sort edits by position (reverse order) to apply from end to beginning
3. Validate that edit regions don't overlap before applying
4. Or: Find all matches first, then apply in reverse position order

---

### 2. **No Validation for Overlapping Matches** (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Location**: Both files, fuzzy matching logic

**Problem**: If a user provides multiple edits that would match overlapping or identical regions of text, the tool doesn't detect or prevent this, leading to unpredictable results.

**Example Scenario**:
```javascript
edits: [
  { searchText: "function test", replaceText: "async function test" },
  { searchText: "test()", replaceText: "testAsync()" }
]
// Both could match "function test()" - which wins?
```

**Current Behavior**: Second edit searches in already-modified content, potentially missing its intended target or matching something unexpected.

**Recommendation**:
- Add overlap detection for matched regions
- Warn or error if edits would affect the same text
- Provide clear ordering/priority rules

---

### 3. **Sliding Window Performance Issue** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Location**: Both files, `findFuzzyMatch()` method, lines 392-423 (aider.ts)

**Problem**: The nested loops create O(n*m*w) complexity where:
- n = content length
- m = number of window sizes (typically 40% of search length)
- w = window size

For a 10KB file and 100-character search text, this results in **~400,000 similarity calculations**.

**Current Code**:
```typescript
for (let windowSize = minWindowSize; windowSize <= maxWindowSize; windowSize++) {
  for (let i = 0; i <= contentLength - windowSize; i++) {
    const candidateText = content.substring(i, i + windowSize);
    const similarity = this.calculateSimilarity(searchText, candidateText);
    // ❌ Can be hundreds of thousands of iterations
  }
}
```

**Impact**:
- Long execution times for large files
- Timeout risk for files over ~50KB
- CPU-intensive operations blocking event loop

**Recommendation**:
1. Add early termination when perfect match (1.0 similarity) is found
2. Use larger step sizes for initial scan, then refine
3. Add configurable max file size / search complexity limit
4. Consider Boyer-Moore or other string matching optimizations

---

### 4. **Missing Edge Case: Zero-Length Search** (LOW SEVERITY)

**Location**: Both files, input validation

**Problem**: While `minLength: 1` is specified in schema, there's no runtime check. If somehow a zero-length searchText gets through, the fuzzy matcher would behave unexpectedly.

**Current Code**:
```typescript
async execute(params: AiderParams): Promise<AiderResult> {
  // No explicit check for searchText.length > 0
  for (const [idx, edit] of params.edits.entries()) {
    const { searchText, replaceText, similarityThreshold = 0.8 } = edit;
    // ❌ What if searchText === ""?
    const match = this.findFuzzyMatch(content, searchText, similarityThreshold);
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Potential infinite loop or crash in window size calculation

**Recommendation**: Add explicit runtime validation:
```typescript
if (!edit.searchText || edit.searchText.length === 0) {
  throw new ValidationError('searchText', edit.searchText, 'non-empty string required');
}
```

---

### 5. **Normalization Removes Too Much Information** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Location**: Both files, `normalizeForComparison()` method, lines 446-453

**Problem**: The normalization removes leading spaces from all lines, which could make functionally different code appear similar.

**Current Code**:
```typescript
private normalizeForComparison(text: string): string {
  return text
    .replace(/\r\n/g, '\n')
    .replace(/\t/g, '  ')
    .replace(/[ ]+/g, ' ')      // Multiple spaces → single
    .replace(/\n[ ]+/g, '\n')   // ❌ Removes ALL leading whitespace
    .trim();
}
```

**Example Problem**:
```javascript
// These become identical after normalization:
"if (x) {\n  return true;\n}"
"if (x) {\nreturn true;\n}"  // Missing indentation

// Both normalize to:
"if (x) {\nreturn true;\n}"
```

**Impact**:
- Could match code with incorrect indentation
- Python or YAML files would have structural differences erased
- False positives in similarity matching

**Recommendation**:
- Preserve relative indentation (normalize to smallest indent level)
- Or: Make normalization configurable
- Or: Count leading spaces but normalize their representation

---

### 6. **Diff Generation Algorithm is Simplistic** (LOW SEVERITY)

**Location**: Both files, `generateDiff()` method, lines 499-532

**Problem**: The diff algorithm treats every line difference as a simultaneous delete+add, producing verbose and sometimes confusing diffs.

**Current Code**:
```typescript
if (originalLines[i] === modifiedLines[j]) {
  diff.push(` ${originalLines[i]}`);
  i++; j++;
} else {
  diff.push(`-${originalLines[i]}`);  // ❌ Always deletes original
  diff.push(`+${modifiedLines[j]}`);  // ❌ Always adds modified
  i++; j++;  // ❌ Assumes 1:1 line correspondence
}
```

**Problem**: Doesn't handle:
- Multiple lines deleted
- Multiple lines inserted
- Lines moved/reordered

**Example**:
```diff
# If you insert 2 lines and delete 1 line, the diff will be incorrect
-original line 1
+new line 1
-original line 2
+new line 2
# Missing: +new line 3
```

**Impact**: Dry-run diffs may be misleading

**Recommendation**: Use proper diff algorithm (Myers, or library like `diff` npm package)

---

## Optimization Opportunities

### Optimization 1: Early Exit on Perfect Match

**Location**: `findFuzzyMatch()` loops

**Current**: Continues searching even after finding 1.0 similarity match

**Recommendation**:
```typescript
if (similarity === 1.0) {
  return {
    position: i,
    text: candidateText,
    similarity: 1.0
  };
}
```

**Impact**: Could reduce execution time by 90%+ when exact matches exist

---

### Optimization 2: Memoization of Levenshtein Calculations

**Location**: `calculateSimilarity()` and `levenshteinDistance()`

**Problem**: Same string pairs might be compared multiple times if searches overlap

**Recommendation**: Add LRU cache for similarity calculations (limit to ~100 entries)

---

### Optimization 3: Skip Normalization for Exact Threshold

**Location**: `calculateSimilarity()`

**Current**: Always normalizes even for threshold=1.0

**Recommendation**:
```typescript
if (threshold === 1.0) {
  // Skip normalization, just compare directly
  return str1 === str2 ? 1.0 : 0.0;
}
```

---

## Code Quality Issues

### Issue 1: Duplicated Code Between Tools

**Problem**: AiderTool and RawAiderTool share **95% identical code**:
- Entire fuzzy matching logic duplicated
- Levenshtein algorithm duplicated
- Normalization logic duplicated
- Diff generation duplicated

**Lines of Duplication**: ~450 lines

**Recommendation**: Extract shared logic into `FuzzyMatcher` utility class:

```typescript
// src/utils/fuzzyMatcher.ts
export class FuzzyMatcher {
  findFuzzyMatch(content: string, searchText: string, threshold: number): Match | null
  calculateSimilarity(str1: string, str2: string): number
  private levenshteinDistance(str1: string, str2: string): number
  private normalizeForComparison(text: string): string
}

// src/utils/diffGenerator.ts
export class DiffGenerator {
  generateDiff(original: string, modified: string, path: string): string
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for fuzzy logic
- Easier to test and maintain
- Fixes apply to both tools automatically
- Reduces total code by ~450 lines

---

### Issue 2: Inconsistent Error Messages

**Location**: Error handling in both files

**Example**:
```typescript
// aider.ts line 328
`No match found above ${(similarityThreshold * 100).toFixed(0)}% similarity for: "${searchText.substring(0, 50)}..."`

// Could be more helpful with:
// - Current best match and its similarity score
// - Suggestion to lower threshold
// - Context about where it searched
```

---

### Issue 3: No Logging for Debug

**Problem**: No way to debug fuzzy matching decisions without modifying code

**Recommendation**: Add optional verbose logging:
```typescript
if (this.debug) {
  console.error(`Fuzzy match: best=${bestMatch?.similarity.toFixed(2)}, threshold=${threshold}`);
}
```

---

## Test Coverage Gaps

Based on the logic analysis, these scenarios should have tests:

1. **Multiple edits with overlapping regions** - verify behavior
2. **Sequential edits where earlier changes affect later matches** - verify correctness
3. **Large files (>50KB)** - verify performance
4. **Edge cases**:
   - Empty replacement text
   - Search text longer than content
   - Unicode characters
   - Very low threshold (0.1) - verify it doesn't match everything
5. **Normalization edge cases**:
   - All-whitespace search text
   - Mixed tabs and spaces
   - Windows vs Unix line endings

---

## Summary of Recommendations

### High Priority (Fix Soon)
1. ✅ **Fix sequential edit interference** - Track positions or apply in reverse order
2. ✅ **Add overlap detection** - Prevent edits from clobbering each other
3. ✅ **Extract shared code** - Create FuzzyMatcher utility class

### Medium Priority
4. ⚠️ **Optimize sliding window** - Add early exit, larger steps
5. ⚠️ **Fix normalization** - Preserve relative indentation
6. ⚠️ **Improve diff algorithm** - Use proper diff library

### Low Priority
7. 📝 **Add runtime validation** - Zero-length checks
8. 📝 **Better error messages** - Include suggestions
9. 📝 **Add debug logging** - Help troubleshoot matches

---

## Conclusion

Both AiderTool and RawAiderTool have a **solid foundation** with fuzzy matching, but the **sequential edit handling** is the most critical issue that needs addressing. The performance optimization and code deduplication would also provide significant benefits.

The tools are functional for single edits but risky for multiple sequential edits on the same file.

**Estimated effort to fix critical issues**: 4-6 hours
**Estimated effort for full optimization**: 8-12 hours
